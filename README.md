# QS Medi-Cyclone - Quasi-Stationary Mediterranean Cyclones
### Five ways to classify Mediterranean cyclones based on their stationarity.

QS Medi-Cyclone is a pyton script intended to detect the most persistent or stationary cyclone tracks in a dataset. Five metrics are used to define (quasi-) stationarity: ...
Each metric is derived from either speed or distance and takes into account either the total life cycle of a cyclone (FT, full-track stationarity) or only a part of it (AT, along-track stationarity).
